Create React app 
packages for basic snippet and stucture of the app (Commands): 
    ~npx create-react-app my-app  (This is for if we want to use the package for only single use).
    ~cd my-app 
    ~npm start


Some useful Commands :
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd my-app
  npm start

Happy hacking!
